## Why the name "Flashlight"
> Just for clarification, I didn't knew that there was already other "flashlight" library for machine learning written in C++. I only searched the crates.io for packages with similar name

Before I decided on the name, I wanted to use some  mythology reference, because I assumed that the "Torch" library based its name on Prometheus myth, but it didn't click.

Some time after that, I thought to myself "Why base the name on some mythical meaning of stuff, when I can refer to them literally.", and that's when I came up with three name ideas for project: "**Lamp**", "**Bulb**" and "**Flashlight**", and well... I decided on "Flashlight" because It sounded the **goofiest** of them all.

Sure, I could've tried to justify it with something like, "*Flashlight is written in Rust and Torch is written In C, so Flashlight is safer, like how flashlights are safer than torches...*" but I would be lying if I did. I decided on that name **because it was funny**, and I didn’t think it would actually fit the project — but here we are, and now it feels like the perfect name.

I hope you had a good time reading this short story of myself. I just rly wanted to include that in the readme, so deal with it.
